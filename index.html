              “Based on everything you know about me,” they ask ChatGPT,

              ChatGPT appears to mix safe bets with more specific details. 
              It often produces images of people sitting in a home office with a computer.
              Perhaps an acoustic guitar sits in the corner or an orange cat prowls in the background. 
              But also on occasion something like, say, a large head of broccoli will be sitting in the middle of the desk.

                Pitfall 3: Comparison with Human Intelligence | Pitfall 16: Downplaying Human Labor
                <br>Though a common theme, the author compares the output of AI to the capability of a human performing a job.
                Realistically, we all know that an AI is capable at what it's been trained to do, but it entirely neglects 
                the social aspects of a "capable carnival mind reader". The showmanship of a carnival worker is the majority
                of the experience, especially when compared to the output of AI generated imagery.

                It's worth noting that it isn't just that this is allegorical for "doing tricks" as a carnival worker would:
                the immediate comparison is to a human, and the automatic assumption is that the chatbot is doing something a 
                human <em>could</em> do.

            <br> The claim is that through "absorbing" every piece of information you've ever inputted into AI, it can 
            produce "patterns and connections that are not readily apparent". This is not how AI works. It quite literally 
            takes all of the given information, puts it on a very, very complex map, and spits out the output based on that.
            When it comes to images, it does this by taking the most common areas of visual clarity with general color matches.
            It is taking the <em>most probable</em> route to whatever conclusion it predicts you most likely want:
            By its very nature, it will not reveal anything that is not already readily apparent.

          As a board member at Microsoft and an early funder of ChatGPT’s developer, OpenAI,

          <br> Simply put, AI is not meant to accomplish that. 
          <br> The vast majority of use cases for AI are present in the accessibility or cost-effectiveness of an AI over a human.
          It's ludicrous to think that billions of users would use AI on a daily basis, even if AI companies somehow had the capacity
          for these users and billions of globally applicable use cases to go along with it.
          Moreso, to say that a tool designed to do something a person could do, but for less expense, would somehow "amplify human labor". 
          Each drawing generated is one that did not come from our own hands, each essay written one that 
          did not hone skill or present struggle. If those opportunities we pass by for momentary convenience
          do not help build creativity, then it's hard for me to say what does.

          AI doesn't <em>think</em>. It takes information, matches it to its massive database, and predicts what the
          most common responses are to that information matching its many different tags at different weights. 
          It's fun to believe that the AI can think and decide things, then change based on that like a person but it does not
          <em>actually</em> do that: It's a distinction the author <em>knows</em> as a tech guru, but does not make for

          Just because something is unlikely to happen does not mean it cannot happen.
          The author dismisses all of your personal info getting stolen as just a risk, 
          and then immediately states that "sharing more information in more contexts can improve people's lives". 
          As the author is directly overseeing some of the world's largest AI projects under Microsoft, 
          this is an extremely concerning statement and stance to take toward user privacy in AI.
          Nonetheless, this also just doesn't address the limits on what an AI does and does not store: 
          It certainly doesn't save every single sentence ever sent, but it may save certain weights or parameters 
          that correspond to a user or their general inputs based on a pattern.

          LinkedIn is not responsible for the creation of resumes. While it is a convenient platform for putting a CV

          Recruiters do reach out to candidates on the site now, which is a more recent occurence due to the platform.
          However, it is not because they are sharing information in a new fashion: It is because that information 
          is conveniently consolidated in one place. It's a function of social media platforms in general over a function of

          Tech skeptics have long used the adjective “Orwellian” to cast everything from a video recommendation feature to

          While arguable, this isn't actually true. Having an identity is marketable, but you can just as easily 
          <em>not</em> create and market fame, and instead become rich through alternative means.
          This also ascribes individual identity as the identity of an individual <em>as percieved by the masses</em>

          Decades from now, as you try to remember exactly what sequence of events and life circumstances made you finally 
          decide to go all-in on Bitcoin, your A.I. could develop an informed hypothesis based on a detailed record of your 
          status updates, invites, DMs, and other potentially enduring ephemera that we’re often barely aware of as we create 
          them, much less days, months or years after the fact.

          This is what humans do to reason: We analyze, we make decisions based on the person that we have become through 
          the shaping of millions of tiny events adding to a persona far larger than the sum of these individual actions.
          AI <em>does not do this</em>: It predicts, based on millions of similar events, what the most likely outcome 
          based on those factors is. <br>This also has the implication that an AI can and even will have access 
          to everything you do online, presented as a net positive. Personally, I would not want everything I do analyzed 
          at every given moment pushed through an AI owned by a private corporation.

          The author speaks largely of how he wants AI to "amplify human creativity". All I can see when he speaks of this 
          is the slow degragation of human creativity as we lose the ability to develop the skills for creativity, replaced 
          by the allure of convenience and the slow death of effort. <br>
          As people, we need to struggle a little. We need to be wrong, to work out what things are to us instead of 
          simply having every available answer immediately given to us. If the first option at every corner is AI, I don't think 
          people would excise the self-control needed to spend some time, work something out, and make their own conclusions.

          Having detailed information about a subject does not make the stored data a 'second self', it just gives you 
          the ability to interpret data on that subject with more accuracy. AI can do that, previous comments about how it 
          'thinks' in mind: But trying to interpret a person's behavior and psyche based on how they use the internet 
          over how they interact with each individual thing in their lives is inaccurate and somewhat short sighted.
          <br> People generally use the internet as a tool, to accomplish some kind of purpose each time it is used: 
          We do not know why they intend to accomplish that goal, nor why they are doing it in the way that they are.

          There’s more to this shift. While critics of Big Tech often emphasize how A.I. can empower corporations to use people’s
          data for manipulation or discrimination, we can also deliberately design A.I. to give individuals greater facility to 
          derive insights from their own data. <mark data-annotation-id="1" aria-details="p11c1">

          Advertisers have had a massive cultural and legal victory over the internet: It is commonplace, even expected 
          for an ad to appear in any available spot in any non-professional website. Critics of big tech say that AI
          can use people's data for manipulation/discrimination because it inherently will: If advertising was dissuaded from 
          using their bought data to target advertisements, a market gap for targeted advertisements would open up. 
          Not even mentioning the consistent 13th pitfall overarching the entire article, this data would be 
          used by for-profit companies. To clarify, advertising data that was still gathered but not used 
          to advertise products to consumers is potential profit left off the table by an AI company that would tell users 
          they were being manipulated by adverts: If an AI could tell you that you were being manipulated by an advert, it 
          would mean that it would be able to generate those adverts to manipulate you. 
          And it is the natural inclination of a for-profit company to increase its dividends by any means possible, so that 
          data would be put to good use by such a company.

          To some degree, we all self-track and always have.

          We weigh ourselves and record our daily steps or the number of miles we jog, generally in pursuit of some kind of

          We do not do things based on whether we may or may not fail. We try to keep doing them because we want to, because 
          it'd be enjoyable, because it'd change us a little. The idea that knowing you <em>may</em> not commit to something 
          isn't how we would amplify human creativity: We do it by thousands of these little failures, until we can succeed.

            Everything the author has claimed his idea of a future AI can do does not align with their mission to 
            "augment and amplify human creativity, instead of replacing it." Every single use case presented by the author is a 
            replacement of what a person could do, what we actually do, or what we want to do. To amplify something is to 
            boost it beyond what it currently is, and what they have shown it doing is taking away the potential for the base 
            value of human creativity and innovation that AI is meant to expand upon. We would not be finding freedom. 
            We would be losing our ability to see it.

          Throughout the article, the author presented the 13th pitfall throughout nearly every given example 
          of their future idea of AI. They consistently show how they view their perspective of AI over the reality of it
          in a plethora of pitfalls, and that they view their idea's maximum potential of AI as an extension of it should it exhibit
          linear growth over time. AI is already slowly plateauing: It cannot continue at its current pace, nor will it maintain 
          a signifigantly larger population (See DeepSeek's various errors on launch due to user density.) Should AI still manage 
          to maintain its growth, it will still not accomplish the author's stated goal: To amplify human creativity and labor, 
          instead of replacing it. Because it was not a machine built to amplify what a human can do: It was a thing that has 
          always been designed to do it in their place.
