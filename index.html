              I recently learned of a new way people are using artificial intelligence. 
              “Based on everything you know about me,” they ask ChatGPT, 
              “draw a picture of what 
              <mark aria-details="c1" you think >
              my current life looks like.”

              Like any capable carnival mind reader, ChatGPT appears to mix safe bets with more specific details. 
              It often produces 
              <mark data-annotation-id="1" aria-details="p2c1"
                >  images of people sitting in a home office with a computer. </mark
              > Perhaps an acoustic guitar sits in the corner or an orange cat prowls in the background. 
              But also on occasion something like, say, 
              <mark data-annotation-id="2" aria-details="p2c2"
              >a large head of broccoli will be sitting in the middle of the desk. </mark

              For a long time he lived in the toy cupboard or on the nursery
              floor, and no one thought very much about him. He was naturally
              shy, and being only made of velveteen, some of the more expensive
              toys quite snubbed him. The mechanical toys were very superior,
              and looked down upon every one else; they were full of modern
              ideas, and pretended they were real. The model boat, who had lived
              through two seasons and lost most of his paint, caught the tone
              from them and never missed an opportunity of referring to his
              rigging in technical terms. The Rabbit could not claim to be a
              model of anything, for
              <mark data-annotation-id="1" aria-details="t1"
                >he didn’t know that real rabbits existed</mark
              >; he thought they were all stuffed with sawdust like himself, and
              he understood that sawdust was quite out-of-date and should never
              be mentioned in modern circles. Even Timothy, the jointed wooden
              lion, who was made by the disabled soldiers, and should have had
              broader views, put on airs and
              <mark data-annotation-id="2" aria-details="t2"
                >pretended he was connected with Government</mark
              >. Between them all the poor little Rabbit was made to feel
              himself very insignificant and commonplace, and the only person
              who was kind to him at all was the Skin Horse.

                isn't indented because it doesn't have the

              The Skin Horse had lived longer in the nursery than any of the
              others. He was so old that his brown coat was bald in patches and
              showed the seams underneath, and
              <mark data-annotation-id="1" aria-details="bead-necklaces"
                >most of the hairs in his tail had been pulled out to string
                bead necklaces</mark
              >. He was wise, for he had seen a long succession of mechanical
              toys arrive to boast and swagger, and by-and-by break their
              mainsprings and pass away, and he knew that they were only toys,
              and would never turn into anything else. For

              is very strange and wonderful, and only those playthings that are
              old and wise and experienced like the Skin Horse understand all
              about it.
