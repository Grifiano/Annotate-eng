              “Based on everything you know about me,” they ask ChatGPT,

              Like any capable carnival mind reader, ChatGPT appears to mix safe bets with more specific details. 
              It often produces 
              <mark data-annotation-id="1" aria-details="p2c1"

          Off-kilter elements like that are what give these portraits not just their quirky charm but also flashes of epiphany.

          the system teases out patterns and connections that may not be readily apparent. In this way, these portraits don’t just reflect. 
          They also reveal. Presented with such depictions, a user may be compelled to ask: 
          Am I really mentioning cruciferous vegetables in my chats so often that ChatGPT thinks they’re a central part of my life?

          As a board member at Microsoft and an early funder of ChatGPT’s developer, OpenAI, 
          I have a significant personal stake in the future of artificial intelligence. 
          But my stake is more than just financial. I truly believe that by giving billions of people access to A.I. tools
          they can use in whatever ways they choose, we can create a world where A.I. augments and amplifies human creativity 
          and labor instead of simply replacing it.

          That’s why I find these ChatGPT portraits so fascinating: 
          They clarify and dramatize enduring concerns about identity and privacy in the digital age.
           How much exactly is ChatGPT remembering? They implicitly ask. 
           How judiciously is it processing these memories, and who benefits most when it does? 
           As a user of these technologies, do you sense that you’re being monitored in ways that make you feel as if you’re 
           being exposed, controlled and manipulated? Or do you feel seen?

          Few truly powerful technologies come without any risks. 
          Perhaps third parties with different motives and values from your own will somehow gain access to the data. 
          Once made aware of your past patterns, these third parties might be able to effectively anticipate and 
          influence your future decisions. While I recognize that some people see such risks as disqualifying, 
          what I’ve found through my own experiences is that sharing more information in more contexts can also improve people’s
          lives.

          In our concern about potential harms, it can be easy to overlook the many positive effects technology has had. 
          I co-founded LinkedIn, a professional social network, more than two decades ago, but I still get a steady flow of 
          missives from people who have found jobs, started businesses or made promising career changes because of interactions
          they’ve had on the platform.
          And this is all because they’re willing to share information about their work experiences and skills 
          in ways that were once considered both imprudent and impractical.

          Tech skeptics have long used the adjective “Orwellian” to cast everything from a video recommendation feature to 
          turn-by-turn navigation apps as threats to individual autonomy, but the history of technological innovation in the 
          21st century tells a different story. In “1984,” George Orwell’s classic novel of state oppression, powerful 
          telescreens enable a totalitarian regime to rule over dispossessed proles with unchecked omnipotence.
          But today we live in a world where individual identity is the coin of the realm — where plumbers and presidents 
          alike aspire to be social media influencers and cultural power flows increasingly to self-made operators, 
          including the one-man podcasting empire Joe Rogan, the YouTube megastar MrBeast and the human rights activist
          Malala Yousafzai.

          For those who choose to pursue this new reality, the tools that make it possible are multiplying and evolving rapidly. 
          Developers of all sizes have been introducing apps and features that enable you to automatically record, 
          store and analyze virtually anything — or everything — you do on your PC, phone and other devices. 
          In doing so, they turn such data into the material for a de facto second self, one that can endow even the most 
          scatterbrained among us with a capacity for revisiting the past with a level of detail even the novelist Marcel Proust
          might envy.

          There’s more to this shift. While critics of Big Tech often emphasize how A.I. can empower corporations to use people’s
